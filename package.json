TingoDB provides 1 on 1 map of most MongoDB's APIs and it has memory based storage option, so it's very convenient for development / testing purpose or trivial sites. When the project grows bigger, you can easily migrate it to mongodb.\n\n## Introduction of TinogoDB from it's github page\n\nTingoDB is an embedded JavaScript in-process filesystem or in-memory database upwards compatible with MongoDB at the API level.\n\nUpwards compatible means that if you build an app that uses functionality implemented by TingoDB you can switch to MongoDB almost without code changes. This greatly reduces implementation risks and give you freedom to switch to a mature solution at any moment.\n\nAs a proof for upward compatibility, all tests designed to run against both MongoDB and TingoDB. Moreover, significant parts of tests contributed from MongoDB nodejs driver projects and are used as is without modifications.\n\nFor more details please visit http://www.tingodb.com\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall from NPM.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install sails-tingo --save\n```\n\n## Sails Configuration\n\nAdd the tingo config to the `config/connections.js` file.\n\n### Using with Sails v0.10.x / v0.11.x\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports.connections = {\n\n  tingo: {\n    adapter: 'sails-tingo',\n\n    dbPath: 'path/to/tingodb', // Required, set to an empty directory for a new project\n\n    // Optional options:\n    memStore: false, // Enable in memory (no file access) mode.\n    nativeObjectID: false, // Use mongodb style ObjectID for default primary key\n    searchInArray: true // Globally enables support of search in nested arrays\n    // Other options ...\n\n  }\n};\n```\nFor detailed explanation of the options, please refer to TingoDB's documentation:\nhttps://github.com/sergeyksv/tingodb#requiretingodboptions\n\nPlease notice that if you set `nativeObjectID` to `true`, you have to install `bson` npm package:\n\n```\nnpm install bson\n```\n\n## Sails.js\n\nhttp://sailsjs.org\n\n## Waterline\n\n[Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) is a brand new kind of storage and retrieval engine.\n\nIt provides a uniform API for accessing stuff from different kinds of databases, protocols, and 3rd party APIs. That means you write the same code to get users, whether they live in MySQL, LDAP, MongoDB, or Facebook.\n\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nBig thanks to the contributors of `sails-mongo`, `tingodb`! Most code of this project is from sails-mongo.\n\n\n## Sails.js License\n\n### The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright © 2012-2013 Mike McNeil\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
